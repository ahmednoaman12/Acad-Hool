            advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on or within the
            Noon Academy Platform or content; or the sale of advertising,

            similar Noon Academy Platform as that of Noon Academy. You agree to
            receive installs and updates from time to time from Noon Academy.

            sends more request messages to Noon Academy’s servers in a given
            period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same
            period by using a conventional on-line web browser. Notwithstanding

            questions or other information as long as the content is not
            illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy,
            infringement of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious
            to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain

            all times comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Noon
